## WG Manager Site
```
This website is made for my foundations project.
```

### Project Description
If you have ever lived in a WG (Wohngemeinschaft), you know that it can be quite a problem to manange and organize certain aspects.  Everyone has their own schedule and it can sometimes be chaotic to co-ordinate.

With the WG Manager Site, you can easily manage and have an overview of different aspects of your WG at your own convenience.

### Planned Features
* User Authentication with Login/Logout
* Create, Edit and Delete Events and Reminders (_eg: something that needs to be done_) and Splits (_for shared costs of shared goods_)
* Comment on Events, Reminders and Splits
